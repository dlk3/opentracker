# Building an opentracker RPM for Fedora COPR

[opentracker](https://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) is an open and free bittorrent tracker project. It aims for minimal resource usage and is intended to run on a wlan router.  

This project contains the process I use to build Fedora RPMs for opentracker which I push to my [COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dlk/rpms/).
